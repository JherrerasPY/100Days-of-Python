# 100Days-of-Python
100 Days learning how to use Python for my own studies

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** journey  
This repository contains 100 daily projects, exercises, and scripts built using Python — one for each day of consistent learning and practice.

## About the Challenge

Inspired by the idea of building coding habits, this project is a personal challenge to:
-  Code every day for 100 days
-  Build projects from scratch
-  Reinforce Python concepts from beginner to advanced
-  Document progress in an organized, searchable way

Each file represents one day’s work — either a small project, a coding problem solution, or a topic I explored.

## I cover a wide range of Python topics such as:

- Variables, loops, functions
- File I/O and exceptions
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Data structures (lists, dicts, sets, tuples)
- Working with APIs and libraries
- Web scraping
- Automations and scripts
- Data processing and analysis (pandas, NumPy)
- And more...

If you’d like to:
- Suggest improvements 
- Collaborate on an idea 
- Or just say hi
