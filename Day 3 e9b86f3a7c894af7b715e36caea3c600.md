## Calcular año Bisiesto (Leap Year)

```python
This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 

**except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 

**unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇

condition_1 = year%4
condition_2 = year%100
condition_3 = year%400

if condition_1 == 0:
    if condition_2 == 0:
        if condition_3 == 0:
            print("Leap year.")
        else:
            print("Not leap year.")
    else:
        print("Leap year.")
else:
    print("Not leap year.")
```

## Love Calculator

```python
# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is their name? \n")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇

lower_name1 = name1.lower()
lower_name2 = name2.lower()
names = lower_name1+lower_name2

t = names.count("t")
r = names.count("r")
u = names.count("u")
e = names.count("e")
true = t+r+u+e

l = names.count("l")
o = names.count("o")
v = names.count("v")
e2 = names.count("e")
love = l+o+v+e2

true_love = int(str(true)+str(love))

if true_love <10 or true_love >90:
    print(f"Your score is {true_love}, you go together like coke and mentos.")
elif true_love>40 and true_love<50:
    print(f"Your score is {true_love}, you are alright together.")
else:
    print(f"Your score is {true_love}.")
```
