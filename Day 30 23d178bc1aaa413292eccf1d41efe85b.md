## What I Learned Today

Exceptions: It is like a if statement for errors

- try: might cause exception
- except: do this is there was an exception (you just expecify the error)
- else: do this is there were no exceptions
- finally: do this no matter what happens

Raising Exceptions:

raise keyerror. (create an error)

JSON library:

- json.dump(): write
- json.load(): read
- json.update(): update

## Exception

```python
**#Exception Handling

try:
    file = open("a_file.txt")
    a_dictionary = {"key": "value"}
    print(a_dictionary["key"])
except FileNotFoundError:
    file = open("a_file.txt", "w")
    file.write("Something")
except KeyError as error_message:
    print(f"The key {error_message} does not exist.")
else:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
finally:
    raise TypeError("This is an error that I made up.")

#BMI Example

height = float(input("Height: "))
weight = int(input("Weight: "))

if height > 3:
    raise ValueError("Human Height should not be over 3 meters.")

bmi = weight / height ** 2
print(bmi)**
```
