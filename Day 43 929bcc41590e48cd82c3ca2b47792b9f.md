## What I Learned Today

ADD CSS

I.- Inline: Same line as html

Just for specific sections

<tag style=”css”/>

II.- Internal: In between tags

Select as many element as we want

Only for one html document

<style>css</style>

III.- External: Separate file

<link rel=”relationship” href=”./style.css”/>

CSS SELECTORS:

1) Element selector

css selector{

property: value

}

eg:

h1 {

color: blue

}

2) Class selector: could apply for many elements

.red-heading{

color: red

}

3) Id selector: only one element

#main{

color: red

}

4) Attribute selector:

element[attribute=value]{

color: red

}

5) Universal selector: apply to all

*{

color: red

}
