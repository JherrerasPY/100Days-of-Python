## What I Learned Today

Open files:

file = open("my_file.txt")

contents = file.read()

print(contents)

file.close() # Don’t forget to close

with this estructura yo don’t need to close:

with open("my_file.txt") as file:    

contents = file.read()    

print(contents)

By default you con just READ documents, if you want to write change the mode

with open("my_file.txt", mode ="w") as file:    

file.write("Chaoo")

**If the file did not exist before, python create it

## Key Concepts

- Absolute File Path: Star for absolute the root (Eg: /work/proyect/talk.ppt)
- Working Directory: The directory where we are currently working on (Eg. ./tal.ppt # eye with the dot at the beginning)
    - to coming out of the folder you just uso 2 dots (Eg. ../report.doc)
- Relative File Path: relative tu your current working direction. (eg. ../../Desktop/my_file.txt)

## Mail Merge

```python
with open("./Input/Names/invited_names.txt") as names:
    name_mail = names.readlines()

with open("./Input/Letters/starting_letter.txt") as letters:
    text_mail = letters.readlines()

for _ in range(0, len(name_mail)):
    name_mail_final = name_mail[_].replace("/n", "").strip()
    carta = ""
    for _ in range(0, len(text_mail)):
        text_mail_final = text_mail[_].replace("[name]", f"{name_mail_final}").strip()
        carta += text_mail_final + "\n"
    with open(f"./Output/ReadyToSend/{name_mail_final}.txt", mode="w") as file:
        file.write(carta)
```
